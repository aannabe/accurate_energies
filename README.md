# accurate_energies


Dataset for "Accurate total energies of pseudopotentials"

Included are various input and output files for Molpro and QMC codes. For each code, outputs are organized according to the ECP label and the symmetry group used in the calculations. SA stands for state-averaged. Full/half-full shell atoms are only included in D2h folders.
