Dataset for "Accurate atomic total energies for correlationconsistent effective core potentials"

Included are various input and output files for various codes. For each code, outputs are organized according to the ECP label and the symmetry group used in the calculations. State-averaged (SA) calculations are included if the shell is not full or half-full.
